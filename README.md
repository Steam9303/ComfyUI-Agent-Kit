# comfyui-claude-kit

**The signature ComfyUI skill for Claude Code, by [AI VFX NEWS](https://t.me/AI_VFX_NEWS).**

Make Claude Code drive a local **ComfyUI** at full power, generate images, video, and audio, build and run
workflows, and **show the graph live in your own ComfyUI canvas**, then hand the whole setup to someone else
with one command.

This is the portable, machine-independent version of a working ComfyUI + Claude setup. Clone it, run the
installer, and your Claude Code gets the same stack, wired to *your* hardware.

## The four-layer stack

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/assets/architecture.png" width="880" alt="The four-layer stack: knowledge + client, MCP driver, in-graph Claude nodes, node-building skills, plus the template library and GUI bridge">

</div>

| Layer | What | Installed as |
|------:|------|--------------|
| 1 | **Knowledge + client** the operating manual and a zero-dependency HTTP client | `~/.claude/skills/comfyui/` |
| 2 | **MCP driver** ~90 structured tools so Claude operates ComfyUI directly | `comfyui-mcp` (npm) + MCP registration |
| 3 | **In-graph Claude nodes** Claude as a step inside a workflow (prompt enrichment, vision QA) | ComfyUI `custom_nodes` |
| 4 | **Node-building skills** for writing/modifying custom nodes (V3 API) | `~/.claude/skills/comfyui-node-*` |
| + | **Template library** the official 500+ workflow templates, the source of truth | sparse git clone + quick index |

Plus a **GUI bridge**: Claude writes graphs to `<ComfyUI>/user/default/workflows/`, you open them in the
built-in Workflows sidebar and tweak them. No extra "agent panel" node required.

See [docs/LAYERS.md](docs/LAYERS.md) for each layer in detail.

## The template library is the source of truth

The kit clones the official [Comfy-Org/workflow_templates](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/workflow_templates) and
builds a compact lookup index so Claude can match any request to the right template. 534 templates span every
task, image, video, 3D, audio, utilities:

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/assets/templates_by_category.png" width="760" alt="Workflow templates by category: 136 image, 129 video, 107 use cases, 67 utility, 33 3D, 29 audio, and more">

</div>

## It knows every model's dialect

Each generative model rewards a different prompt approach: SDXL wants comma tags, FLUX wants natural-language
sentences, video models want camera and motion direction, audio models want genre/tempo/instruments, and
negative-prompt support varies wildly. The kit ships **[`MODELS.md`](skills/comfyui/MODELS.md)**, a per-model
prompting reference distilled from **official sources** (each maker's docs and model cards, docs.comfy.org, and
the per-model templates from the `anthropic-claude` node). When you name a model in a request or a workflow,
Claude reads that model's entry first and prompts it correctly.

Covered today (65 models with recipes): FLUX.1/.2 + Kontext, Z-Image, Qwen-Image/Edit, SDXL, SD1.5/3.5, HiDream,
Ideogram, Nano Banana Pro/2, Seedream, Recraft, GPT-Image, Grok, Reve, Kandinsky, BRIA, OmniGen, Chroma, Krea,
ERNIE-Image, FireRed/LongCat/ChronoEdit (edit), Capybara, Bernini-R, Anima, NewBie, PixelDiT, Ovis-Image, Lens,
Quiver, Wan 2.1-2.7, LTX-2.3/2 Pro, Hunyuan Video, SVD, Kling, Veo, Sora, Seedance, Luma, Runway, MiniMax, PixVerse,
Vidu, Pika, HappyHorse, HuMo, SCAIL-2, Stable Audio, ACE-Step, ElevenLabs, ChatterBox, Sonilo, Hunyuan3D, Tripo,
Rodin, Meshy. Plus a separate **Enhancement and utility** section (not prompt-driven, settings not prompts):
upscalers and restorers (Real-ESRGAN, SUPIR, SeedVR2, FlashVSR, Topaz, Magnific), frame interpolation (FILM, RIFE),
conditioning helpers (SAM3, BiRefNet, Depth Anything, DWPose, MoGe, IP-Adapter, LivePortrait, Mediapipe), and video
object removal (VOID). Anything else falls back to the template library.

**Full model index** — every model in the library and exactly what the kit has for it (recipe / utility /
template-only): **[docs/MODEL_INDEX.md](docs/MODEL_INDEX.md)**.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI (`claude` on PATH)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (`node` + `npm`)
- [git](https://git-scm.com), [Python 3](https://python.org)
- A local **ComfyUI** install (Desktop or source), [comfy.org](https://www.comfy.org/)

## Install

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SlavaSexton/comfyui-claude-kit.git
cd comfyui-claude-kit
./install.ps1 -ComfyUIPath "E:\path\to\ComfyUI"   # -ComfyUIPath is optional
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SlavaSexton/comfyui-claude-kit.git
cd comfyui-claude-kit
./install.sh --comfyui-path /path/to/ComfyUI       # --comfyui-path is optional
```

The installer is **idempotent**, re-run it any time. Flags: `-SkipTemplates` / `--skip-templates` (skip the
~900MB template clone), `-SkipNodes` / `--skip-nodes` (skip the in-graph Claude nodes). If you omit the ComfyUI
path, it prints ComfyUI Manager instructions for the nodes instead of cloning them.

## First run on a new machine

After install, start ComfyUI, then in a Claude Code session tell Claude to run the **bootstrap** once
([docs/BOOTSTRAP.md](docs/BOOTSTRAP.md)): it detects your GPUs, paths, and installed models via the MCP
`health_check` and fills the machine-specific block in the skill, then does a smoke-test generation. After that,
just ask for media, the skill auto-activates on ComfyUI keywords.

## Optional: in-graph Claude key

Only needed if you want a workflow to enrich prompts **without** Claude in the loop (e.g. an unattended pipeline):

```powershell
setx CLAUDE_API_KEY "sk-ant-..."   # then restart ComfyUI
```

See [docs/NODES.md](docs/NODES.md). When you are driving, Claude writes prompts directly, better and free.

## What is and isn't in this repo

In the repo (original work, MIT): the skill, the client, the installer, the index generator, the docs, the
generated visuals. Fetched at install time from their own sources (not redistributed here): the `comfyui-mcp`
package, the node-building skills, the workflow templates, and the in-graph Claude nodes.
